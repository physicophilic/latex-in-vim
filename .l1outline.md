# L1 outline

What are the most important things for first lecture?

1. Some kind of demonstration to make people work. If they don't get excited (by me doing a sloppy presentation)
then they'll not use it. 
2. Installation of vim.
    2.1 A five minute intro to vim modes and keys.
3. Making it less ugly - get a colour scheme. 

Add additional things that must be fit in to make it smooth (if any) in the next line.


So what are the things that are necessary to make this happen?

1. Creating a new user/new vim setup in a repository. 
    1.1 Creating new setup is as easy as unlinking .vim folder and then making a new one, with colors and vimrc in it. Shifting to termite will would
    be the last thing required.
2. Preparing install notes for Windows and other places. I would wait for people to do this. (Very important).
3. Preparing 3 minute vim intro to modes.
4. Installing a colour scheme. 
    4.1. Telling them where to find them
    4.2. Install location


But people might not be happy after this - they might want what Gilles does right in the first lecture (like I did)
So, maybe a small outline of how to do rest of Gilles part 1 can be given. 

What would that part require anyway?

- Git
- vim-plug
- Installing UltiSnips, python3, zathura/alternative, vimtex
- Setting up UltiSnips

These would be bare minimum requirements. And without learning vim first these would = copy pasting.

So that defines the l1 outline. Now, I need to make these things happen. A bit of research would be needed.

## L1 core

I am going with creating a new vim setup within i3. Ubuntu would be unnecessarily difficult. Plus, the population interested in this
is small, so we'll be fine. I know how to do this, so there aren't any worries. I am not using vim, so I can do it even right now.
